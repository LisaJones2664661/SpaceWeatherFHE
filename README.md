## Use Cases

1. **Power Grid Resilience**
   - Assess risk of geomagnetic storms on transformers and distribution networks

2. **Telecommunications Protection**
   - Evaluate impact of solar storms on satellite and ground-based communication systems

3. **Cross-Company Emergency Planning**
   - Share encrypted data to coordinate mitigation strategies without revealing internal operations

4. **Regulatory Compliance**
   - Enable risk reporting while maintaining data privacy
